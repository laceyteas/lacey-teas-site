## Deposits

As of March 2021 I require deposits for all new clients. Deposit will be 25% of the session fee paid by Venmo or Cash App. Full deposit will be refunded in case of cancellation up to 48 hrs before the appointment. If canceled after this window your deposit will be kept as a cancellation fee.

## Local San Francisco Outcall Rates

* 1 hr – $500
* Dinner Date – $1,600
* Overnight – $2,500

## Incall

* 1 hr – $600

For PSE or couples plese add $200/hr to my base rate. PSE is available only to established and trusted clients. In session extensions are $300/hr 

* ## Safety

If you have respiratory symtpoms please let me know and I will waive the cancellation fee. I am trusting you to be honest with me We are in uncertain times right now and I believe in harm reduction and clear communication.

### Longer Experiences and Travel:

Once we get to know each other, I am open to overnight stays and longer experiences and the possibly of travel — an entire day together at the amusement park, an adventure to cabin in the woods, or even to be your companion on a trip abroad! If these sorts of experiences interest you we can discuss what the proper compensation would be at that time, and when travel restrictions lift.

## Reserving Our First Time Together

I ask that all first time clients submit their full name, phone number and email address, as well as references for verification purposes. References need to be either two provider references or one provider reference and employment verification. *I take your security seriously and will keep your information private.*

Please also include when, where, and for how long you would like to meet. Clients will be expected to cover travel costs to outcall appointments over 45 minutes outside of the Bay Area. I am happy to host in-call appointments in Oakland and San Francisco.

I love pre-bookings with at least 48 hours notice. I spend a great deal of time and effort getting ready for you, and appreciate your understanding and consideration of my time. I am disability friendly and accepting of all gender expressions, ages (21+) and races. I also welcome couples.

Thoughtful, respectful and honest messages only please. Additional meeting etiquette will be clarified after your appointment is confirmed.
