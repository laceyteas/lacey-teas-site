Hello darling!

Ever since childhood, I loved playing make believe. I collect many eclectic and unusual experiences often seeking adventures that challenge my creativity. Spending time abroad and in books taught me how to find enjoyment and comfort in almost any situation. I take pride in extending that sense of belonging to friends. 



The bohemian value of passionate expression above all else inspires my style. I encourage those who seek my company to feel safe in sharing with me their deepest desires shamelessly. Building an experience from trust and acceptance are the cornerstones of our shared adventures together. As an event planner and experience curator, I am happy collaborating in most any role. I lead comfortably. 



Across my shapely torso and long legs, you might notice a carefully curated collection of tattoos. They each come with stories as unique as their form. I often exaggerate my hourglass figure by wearing corsets. Detail to attention and process using fine materials are some of the things I miss about the old world. My hair color changes with my whimsy, though these days Iâ€™ve been sporting a soft pink. Strangers often compliment me on my eyes. Are they grey, green, or blue?



As much as I indulge in glamor, I take pleasure in throwing on a pair of overalls to tend to my garden feeling the soft earth beneath my feet. Nothing brings me such joy as sipping tea while watching the sunset or catching a classic film at the Castro theatre. Tell me, what brings you pleasure? What brings you joy? What do you savor?
