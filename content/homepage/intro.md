Darling,

I woke up dreaming of you. The crisp linen sheets still tossed with your imprint. I slip into the silk robe you gifted me from your travels, the one that you claim transforms me into a Waterhouse nymph. My curves and edges chassé behind the curtains as I mist the orchids next to my window. After perusing my playlists, I settle on a dreamy Billie Holiday album and draw myself a bath.

The steam rising blends with an earthy musk you left on me. As the singer reveals her own warbly longing, I too dream of spending April in Paris with you- strolling down the cobblestones of Rue Cremieux on a rainy day, my tiny heels clicking and splashing as we rush to our dinner reservation.

You tell me that my eyes are the same shade of green as your childhood crush. Blushing, I admit that I would love to make believe with you. I dare you to try an exotic fruit you never tasted, promising that you will relish a new experience at the very least. Your turn.

Eagerly, we make it back to our charming suite. I slowly unzip my dress revealing my hourglass figure while the candle light flickers softening your gaze. Choose your own adventure.

Breathless, we trade dreams before dawn. Thank you for choosing to spend time with me.

Let it be real…

XO,

Lacey
