What makes your imagination spark? What brings you joy? Exploration, conversation and knowledge fuel my fire and bring me constant inspiration. I enjoy the creative process of creating my own costumes and designing photoshoots, either self shot or with wonderful photographer friends. I have many passions and my biggest one is connecting and exploring with new friends. I would love to connect to you, please explore my site to find out how!
